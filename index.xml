      <description>Taking the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company Space Y, that would like to compete with SpaceX, I had to predict whether the first stage of Falcon 9 Rocket will land successfully.
The following data analysis procedures were used for this project:
1)Data Collection ( Using the SpaceX API and webcraping)
2)Data Wrangling
3)EDA with SQL and Data Visualization(MatplotLib)
4)Interactive Visual Analytics ( Data Visualization wiht folium and building a Dashboard with Ploty Dash)</description>

      <description>My love for science and my desire to solve problems led me to choose mechanical engineering as my field studies. My studies in Engineering helped me to further sharpen my problem-solving skills and ultimately taught me a way to approach and deal with any challenges that may arise in my life.
During my studies, I became passionate about applied mathematics, statistics, mathematical optimization, and programming. My greatest achievement by far is my thesis project.</description>
